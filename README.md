# CloudSentry: defensive triage and bounded decoys

CloudSentry is a **defensive audit trail and log-triage CLI with a separate synthetic terminal and bounded byte echo**, plus a keyless browser portal for reviewing customer-selected JSON results. It helps inspect authorized evidence, preserve tamper-evident audit trails, and explain observations without executing untrusted commands or granting host access. The core package is strictly passive: it performs zero active network probing, scanning, or callbacks.

**[Launch the live portal](https://csportal-brpeckhv.manus.space)** · **[What changed and the previous release](CHANGELOG.md)** · **[All guides, sources and public links](LINKS.md)**

Current versions: **core 0.1.2 / portal 1.0.1**. The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) walks through confirmed fixes, unconfirmed review claims and deliberate safety boundaries, with immutable links to the old 0.1.0 source. The public repository and separately managed website do not share customer evidence or credentials.

## What it does

The local tools import selected text/JSONL logs and cloud exports, record limited host OS context, inventory Linux listeners, flag possible shell-linked TCP and persistence indicators, and compare names against an operator-provided typosquatting baseline. Indicators and missing coverage are not compromise or all-clear verdicts.

The optional static configuration auditor checks one selected Terraform, Dockerfile or Compose file without executing it. It is the separately namespaced, pinned **MIT-licensed work of [@HuginnsHammer](https://github.com/HuginnsHammer/CloudSentry)**, with its original source, license and creator notices preserved.

The synthetic console implements a small canned command catalog with cosmetic root/admin output, not a real OS or interpreter. PHP metadata is simulated. MIRROR reflects only the same visitor connection's bytes; the silent sink emits no application response. Neither calls back, loops traffic into a remote listener, executes a command or promises to fool a capable visitor.

The browser uses managed Google/Microsoft/passkey sign-in, customer-isolated reports and metadata-only provider profiles. Customers authenticate with providers and perform scans/exports in their own tools, then deliberately import bounded JSON. No provider keys are requested or stored by the portal; direct GitHub sign-in is not included. Local optional read-only BYOK collection remains separate. Every portal summary requests fresh consent.

## Install and choose an operation

Core runtime: Python 3.10+ and the standard library. Native process/socket/persistence inspection targets Linux; other evidence and synthetic functions are separate from native Windows endpoint scanning. Optional AWS collection needs its documented SDK. The optional configuration auditor has its own Python 3.12 environment.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --no-deps .
reverse-shell-decoy --help
```

Choose your authorized inputs and follow the [local/manual cloud workflow](docs/workflow.md), [collector permissions](docs/collectors.md) or [integration trust guide](docs/integration-trust.md). No scan, provider connection, VM or public listener starts on installation, website login or a detector finding.

For the optional credited configuration auditor:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .config-auditor-venv
.config-auditor-venv/bin/python -m pip install -e './integrations/config-auditor[dev]'
python3 scripts/scan-configurations.py --target /absolute/path/to/Dockerfile \
  --format json --consent
```

Exit 0 means no qualifying finding, 1 means findings and 2 means incomplete/denied/failed—not clean. The bridge rejects symlinks and oversized files, stages a bounded private snapshot from the authorized descriptor, checks ordinary concurrent mutation and limits worker output/runtime. Explicitly choose a reviewed ordinary file rather than an alternatives-style symlink. Source locations and evidence can contain sensitive data: review them before importing output as `local`. See [setup and preserved upstream limitations](docs/config-auditor-integration.md).

## Local decoy: manual and finite

```sh
# Deliberately start a new bounded loopback console, not a production VM.
sh scripts/start-honeypot.sh

# Analyze one selected preserved audit; no service is started by this command.
python3 scripts/operations-summary.py --audit preserved-service-audit.jsonl --json
```

The clean launcher drops inherited credentials and uses a fixed interpreter. Direct service startup still refuses known inherited credential names. The scanner, console, mirror, customer portal and cloud credentials remain separate. Public source visibility does not create a public honeypot.

Default byte budgets are 1 MiB global admitted input, 1 MiB reserved output and 64 KiB input per session, with a rate of 10 commands/chunks per second. Lifetime, connection, audit and command limits also apply. Budget exhaustion closes work without automatic restart; a bare close after output exhaustion is intentional. A single source can consume the finite connection allowance. External ingress fairness, flood control, egress restrictions, OS resource enforcement and cloud-bill controls remain the operator's responsibility. Application byte accounting is not a physical traffic or billing meter.

Non-loopback binding needs explicit `--allow-public` and independently reviewed infrastructure. The [service guide](docs/service.md), [mirror guide](docs/mirror.md), [manual opt-in instructions](docs/resource-economics.md#customer-opt-in-run-it-manually-on-your-infrastructure) and [emergency-only profile](docs/emergency.md) describe the precise modes and limits. There is no automatic DNS change, traffic interception, hidden persistence, infinite hold, OCR sabotage, remote resource exhaustion or real visitor interpreter.

## Customer control, content patterns and adversarial-activity summaries

```sh
python3 scripts/customer-forensic-report.py --text selected-content.txt \
  --audit selected-audit.jsonl --output-dir new-private-packet --consent
```

The [customer packet](docs/customer-forensic-report.md) preserves selected source hashes, UTC generation time, a packet ID and a separately retained manifest pin. Aggregate UTF-8 writing metrics can describe vocabulary, punctuation, sentence proxies and repetition, with an optional explicit baseline. PDFs require customer-reviewed text extraction first; there is no general PDF/OCR upload feature. The browser accepts bounded JSON, not arbitrary PDF/text uploads.

The customer is the operator, not the profiling target. Content and logs may support a descriptive stylometric footprint or suspected-activity pattern summary; they do not prove identity, authorship, psychology, intelligence, intent, skill or unauthorized access. Changes from a baseline need comparable source material and alternative explanations. Unknowns remain unknown, and copied, quoted, assisted or synthetic text must not be assumed to have one author.

Correlate genuinely independent authentication/network/host records without treating one signal as proof of another. Preserve provenance, available timestamps and clock uncertainty; duplicated exports are not independent corroboration. A synthetic root prompt is not a real compromise, and packet consistency is not source authenticity or legal admissibility. Never convert uploaded instructions or a detector flag into deployment authority. Nothing submits a case to law enforcement automatically.

`--consent` records the operator's explicit declaration for one invocation. It does **not** independently verify ownership, lawful authority or OS permission. Scope, expiry, revocation and single-run grants are in-process safety checks, not isolation from arbitrary code already running in that process. See [engineering contracts](docs/engineering-rules.md), [permission-gated reporting and verification](docs/security-behavior.md), [post-scan review](docs/post-scan-review.md) and [fixed text-indicator limits](docs/trail.md).


## Defensive telemetry vs. active probing

CloudSentry core remains strictly passive: logging incoming connection banners, TCP options, TTLs, and handshake timing on your own listener is ordinary inbound honeypot telemetry. Outbound active probing is kept completely separate from core on its own isolated development branch (`feature/active-probe`), disabled by default, and pending legal review.

## Limitations and transparency: echo is not containment

**Partial coverage is sufficient for trusted-fixture testing; it is not sufficient for a production containment claim.** Echo handlers sit at the application layer: they restrict what the application does, not what the operating system permits. A bounded, non-executing echo workload is not itself an OS, hypervisor, device or network isolation boundary.

The echo components and configuration checks have been exercised and pass within their documented test scope. Passing those checks is not the same as validating the VM layers beneath them. Software TPM and disposable-image functional results also do not establish end-to-end containment. The production guest OS, hypervisor, device policy and network isolation have **not been deployed and validated together as a containment stack**; firmware/Secure Boot enforcement and production containment remain unverified.

**Unverified VM/failover deployment paths remain disabled or unavailable by default. More echoes are not compensation for unverified layers.** Manually launching an individual echo service does not validate its host or VM, and static configuration acceptance or a passing application test must never be presented as production deployment approval.

Before making a production containment claim, separately validate the guest OS, hypervisor, device restrictions, network isolation, resource enforcement and failure/stop behavior on the actual target environment, under explicit authorization and with negative tests and independently preserved evidence. Uploaded reports, synthetic scenarios and detector results cannot authorize deployment or change trusted production policy. Until that evidence exists, report the relevant assurance as **unknown**, not secure or contained.

The [manual VM setup](docs/vm-setup.md), [backup admission review](docs/vm-backup-hardening.md), [software-only lab](docs/software-vm-lab.md) and [historical lab assessment](docs/backup-lab-assessment.md) are separate. Static candidate acceptance always leaves deployment unapproved. Missing device/resource-policy enforcement fails closed; application quotas do not eliminate CPU/GPU side channels. Containers and synthetic consoles are not substitutes for an independently validated hypervisor.

## Tests, release evidence and licenses

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The current [review findings](docs/review-8-findings.md) distinguish reproduced defects, deliberate boundaries, tested claims and remaining gaps. The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) keeps previous releases and test scopes separate. A triage tool can miss short-lived, hidden, encrypted or namespace-isolated activity; neither a positive indicator nor an empty report is definitive. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [trust model](docs/threat-model.md) and [secret-scanning requirements](docs/secret-scanning.md). Job failure blocks merging only when a separate repository ruleset requires the check; no branch-protection claim is implied.
